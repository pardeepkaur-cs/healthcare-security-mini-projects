# Interpretable Login Risk Scoring System for Healthcare

This project simulates a rule-based, interpretable risk-scoring engine for healthcare system login attempts.

Each login event is evaluated using multiple security-relevant factors including:
- Login time anomalies
- Unfamiliar IP addresses or devices
- Failed login attempts
- User role sensitivity
- Password strength category

The system assigns a cumulative risk score and classifies each login attempt as:
LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH risk.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how explainable security rules can be used to support real-time access monitoring and anomaly detection in sensitive environments such as healthcare systems.

This project uses synthetic data for academic illustration only and does not involve real patient or hospital data.
